      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>My name is Albert Levin, and I am excited to take the GUI Programming I course this semester!</p>
      <p>For my first project, I decided to create a webpage on one of my favorite chess players, Hikaru Nakamura.</p>
      <p>Nakamura was born on December 9, 1987, in Hirakata, Japan. His family moved to the United States when he was just two years old, and he was raised in White Plains, New York. </p>
      <p>He began playing chess at the age of seven. Likewise, he solidified his reputation as a chess prodigy, becoming the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title at the time, breaking the record of Bobby Fischer, another prominent American grandmaster, by three months.</p>
      <p>Nakamura is also now a pivotal contributor to one of the strongest chess scenes in the world. If you would like to learn more, click <a href="https://hikarunakamura.com" target="_blank">here</a>
